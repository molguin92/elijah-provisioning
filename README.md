Elijah: Cloudlet Infrastructure for Mobile Computing
========================================================

A cloudlet is a new architectural element that arises from the convergence of
mobile computing and cloud computing. It represents the middle tier of a 3-tier
hierarchy:  mobile device - cloudlet - cloud.   A cloudlet can be viewed as a
"data center in a box" whose  goal is to "bring the cloud closer". Please visit

Before you start
-----------------

This code is about **rapid provisioning of a custom VM(Virtual Machine)** to
cloudlet using **VM synthesis**. This does not include any code for mobile
applications, rather it provides functions to create **VM overlay** and perform
**VM Synthesis** that will rapidly reconstruct your custom VM at an arbitrary
computer.

Please read [Just-in-Time Provisioning for Cyber
Foraging](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/docdir/ha-mobisys-vmsynthesis-2013.pdf)
to understand what we do here and find the detail techniques.


The key to rapid provisioning is the recognition that a large part of a VM
image is devoted to the guest OS, software libraries, and supporting software
packages. The customizations of a base system needed for a particular
application are usually relatively small.  Therefore, if the ``base VM``
already exists on the cloudlet, only its difference relative to the desired
custom VM, called a ``VM overlay``, needs to be transferred. Our approach of
using VM overlays to provision cloudlets is called ``VM synthesis``.  A good
analogy is a QCOW2 file with a backing file. You can consider ``VM overlay`` as
a QCOW2 file and ``Base VM`` as a backing file. The main difference is that
``VM synthesis`` includes both disk and memory state and it is much more
efficient in generating diff and reconstructing suspended state.



Installing
----------

You will need:

* qemu-kvm
* libvirt-bin
* gvncviewer
* python-libvirt
* python-xdelta3
* python-bsdiff4
* python-dev (to pip install msgpack)
* liblzma-dev (for pyliblzma)
* apparmor-utils (for disable apparmor for libvirt)
* libc6-i386 (for extracting free memory of 32 bit vm)
* libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev (for overlay packaging)
* python libraries at requirements.txt


To install

* run a installation script
  
  > $ sudo apt-get install fabric openssh-server  
  > $ fab install
  > *(Type your Ubuntu account password when it is asked)*



Tested platforms
---------------------

We have tested at __Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit__
(as well as their derivatives such as Kubuntu).

This version of Cloudlet has several dependencies on other projects for further
optimization, and currently we include this dependency as a binary.  Therefore,
we recommend you to use __Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit__. 



How to use
-------------

1. Import ``Base VM``

  First thing you need is a ``Base VM``. ``Base VM`` is a pre-loaded element
  and you can think it as a golden image similar to [Amazon
  AMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Machine_Image).  We provide __sample
  base VM__ of Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit server for easybootstrapping.  Download
  sample ``base VM`` at:

  For Ubuntu 16.04:
  [Base VM for Ubuntu-12.04.01-i386-Server](https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/cloudlet-vm/precise-hotplug-new.zip)
(Ubuntu account for VM : cloudlet, password: cloudlet)


  Then, you can import this ``base VM`` using command line tool, _cloudlet_.

    > $ cloudlet import-base ./precise-hotplug-new.zip  
    > INFO     create directory for base VM  
    > INFO     Decompressing Base VM to temp directory at /tmp/cloudlet-base-k7ANqB  
    > INFO     Place base VM to the right directory  
    > INFO     Register New Base to DB  
    > INFO     ID for the new Base VM: abda52a61692094b3b7d45c9647d022f5e297d1b788679eb93735374007576b8
    > INFO     Success

  You can check the imported ``base VM`` by

    > $ cloudlet list-base  
    > hash value<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>path  
    > \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
    > abda52a<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>/home/krha/.cloudlet/abda52a/precise.raw  
    > \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Perform __VM synthesis__ using a sample ``VM overlay``.

  First, launch the VM synthesis server at Cloudlet.

    > $ synthesis_server  
    > INFO     --------------------------------------------------  
    > INFO     * Base VM Configuration  
    > INFO      0 : /home/krha/.cloudlet/abda52a61692094b3b7d45c9647d022f5e297d1b788679eb93735374007576b8/precise.raw (Disk 8192 MB, Memory 1040 MB)  
    > INFO     --------------------------------------------------  
    > INFO     * Server configuration  
    > INFO      - Open TCP Server at ('0.0.0.0', 8021)  
    > INFO      - Disable Nagle(No TCP delay)  : 1  
    > INFO     --------------------------------------------------  


  Then, you can test VM synthesis using a sample **VM overlay URL** of htop
  command. This process will resume a backend VM that is running a htop
  command. VM overlay URL synthesis_client -s localhost -u https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/cloudlet-vm/overlay-htop.zip

  Demo for the Fluid simulation's back-end server
  ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9MN-kvG_ko))  is temporarily
  unavailable. Instead, you can create your own VM overlay following [How To
  Create VM Overlay](#how-to-create-vm-overlay).

  You can perform VM synthesis using sample VM overlay

    > $ synthesis_client -s localhost -u https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/cloudlet-vm/overlay-htop.zip

  For more details, check out help command **synthesis_client -h**

  If VM synthesis is successful, you will see a screen-shot like

  <img src="https://raw.github.com/cmusatyalab/elijah-provisioning/master/doc/screenshot-synthesis-success-htop.png" align=middle width=480>

  The synthesized VM shows a running htop command that was saved in the VM 
  overlay.  Note that synthesis_client is a TCP client, so you can execute
  it at a different machine.

  If the VM synthesis is failed showing a screen-shot like below, it is due to
  the memory snapshot compatibility of the ``base VM``.

  <img src="https://raw.github.com/cmusatyalab/elijah-provisioning/master/doc/screenshot-synthesis-fail.png" align=middle width=480>

  This kernel panic is causes by CPU flag incompatibility coming from QEMU
  side. We do our best to make a VM memory snapshot work across heterogeneous
  host machine, but it can failed in an old machine. In this case, you need to
  create your own ``base VM`` (See more at [How to create your own Base
  VM](#How-to-create-your-own-Base-VM))


3. VM synthesis in different ways

  In addition to using a synthesis server and a client, you can perform VM
  synthesis 1) using command line tool and 2) using an Android client.  

    1) Command line tool

        > $ cloudlet synthesis /path/to/base_disk.img /path/to/overlay.zip
    
    2) Android client

    We have sample Android client at $HOME/android/android and you can import
    it to ``Eclipse`` as an Android project. This client program will
    automatically find nearby Cloudlet using UPnP if both client and Cloudlet
    are located in same broadcasting domain (e.g. sharing WiFi access point).
    Otherwise, you can manually specify IP address of the Cloudlet by clicking
    cancel in discovery pop-up.
    
    Once installing application at your phone, you have to copy your VM overlay
    to Android phone. For example with Fluid overlay example, download VM
    overlay from <a
    href=https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/cloudlet-vm/overlay-fluid-portable.zip
    target="_blank">https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/cloudlet-vm/overlay-fluid-portable.zip</a>
    and **unzip it**, then copy both overlay-meta and overlay-blob_1.xz file to
    /sdcard/Cloudlet/overlay/fluid/ directory. This directory name, _fluid_,
    will be appeared to your Android application when you're asked to select
    ``Overlay VM``. Right directory name is important since the directory name
    will be	saved as appName in internal data structure and being used to
    launch associated mobile application after finishing ``VM synthesis``. 


  Please recall that the VM synthesis client is designed for **provisioning a custom
  back-end server program at cloudlet** and you need to launch your
  mobile application after finishing VM synthesis. This client application will
  communicate with the back-end server you just provisioned. To launch mobile
  application after VM synthesis, we use Android Activity launcher and the
  directory name is used as an index for associated mobile application. See
  more details at handleSucessSynthesis() method at CloudletConnector.java
  file.

    

Sample application: Fluid Simulation
---------------------------
* Fluid Simulation is an interactive fluid dynamics simulation, that renders a liquid sloshing in a container on the screen of a phone based on accelerometer inputs.  The application back-end runs on Linux and performs a [smoothed particle hydrodynamics](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1531346) physics simulation using 2218 particles, generating up to 50 frames per second.  The structure of this application is representative of real-time (i.e., not turn-based) games.

Details Usage
--------------

### How to create your own Base VM

You can also create your own ``base VM`` from a regular VM disk image. Here the
_regular VM disk image_ means a raw format virtual disk image you normally use
for KVM/QEMU or Xen. 

    > $ cloudlet base /path/to/base_disk.img
    > % Use raw file format virtual disk

This command will launch GUI (VNC) connecting to your guest OS and the code
will start creating ``base VM`` right after you close VNC window. So, please
close the VNC window when you think it's right point to snapshot the VM as a
base VM (typically you close it after booting up).  Then, it will generate
snapshot of the current states for both memory and disk and save that
information to DB. You can check list of ``base VM`` by

    > $ cloudlet list-base
	

### How to create VM overlay

Now you can create your customized VM based on top of ``base VM``  
  
    > $ cloudlet overlay /path/to/base\_disk.img  
    > % Path to base_disk is the path for virtual disk you used earlier  
    > % You can check the path by "cloudlet list-base"  

This will launch VNC again with resumed ``base VM``. Now you can start making
any customizations on top of this ``base VM``. For example, if you're a
developer of ``face recognition`` back-end server, we will install required
libraries, binaries and finally start your face recognition server. After
closing the GUI windows, cloudlet will capture only the change portion between
your customization and ``base VM`` to generate ``VM overlay`` that is a minimal
binary for reconstructing your customized VM.

``VM overlay`` is using zip container and inside of the zip file there are 2
types of files; 1) ``overlay-meta file`` ends with .overlay-meta, 2) compressed
``overlay blob files`` ends with .xz

**If your application need specific TCP/UDP port to communicate with a client,
then you can make a port forwarding using -redir parameter as below.** 

    > $ cloudlet overlay /path/to/base_disk.img -- -redir tcp:2222::22 -redir tcp:8080::80

  This will forward client connection at host port 2222 to VM's 22 and 8080 to 80, respectively.


**Note**: If you have experience kernel panic error like
[this](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/elijah-cloudlet/issues/1), You should
upgrade your Linux kernel to at least 3.13.0 version. This bug is fixed since 
kernel version 3.13.0. If you cannot upgrade the kernel, then please avoid
using EPT. You can disable EPT as follows:

    > $ sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
    > $ sudo modprobe kvm_intel "ept=0"

Troubleshooing
-----------------
1. KVM permission error at the first run

    > failed to initialize KVM: Permission denied
    > No accelerator found!
    > 
    > Error, make sure previous VM is closed and check QEMU_ARGUMENT
    > 
    > Failed to create overlay

  Please logout your session and re-login.

2. Fuse permission error at the first run

  Make sure the current user to have fuse permission. The qemu-kvm library
  changes fuse access permission while it's being installed, and the permission
  is recovered if you reboot the host.  This is a known bug in qemu-kvm
  installation script
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/1152718), so you can
  either reboot the machine to have valid fuse permission of just revert the
  permission manually as bellow.

          > $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/fuse.conf  
          > $ sod sed -i 's/#user_allow_other/user_allow_other/g' /etc/fuse.conf
