* This is binary files of the backend server of the Fluid Simulation

* Fluid Simulation is an interactive fluid dynamics simulation, that renders a
  liquid sloshing in a container on the screen of a phone based on
  accelerometer inputs.  The application backend runs on Linux and performs a
  [smoothed particle hydrodynamics](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1531346)
  physics simulation using 2218 particles, generating up to 50 frames per
  second.  The structure of this application is representative of real-time
  (i.e., not turn-based) games.
